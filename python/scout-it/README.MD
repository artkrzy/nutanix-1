# Snipe-it agent for Windows and Linux

This is work in progress.  

This is meant to be used as an agent for Snipe-it to register assets automatically using the MAC address as the asset tag.  
The agent also inventories installed software and creates the licenses objects in Snipe-It if necessary, then assigns the software to the asset.  
An exclusion list can be specified to ignore specific software (such as those that may not require licensing).
